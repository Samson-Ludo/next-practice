# Key Features of This Structure

# common/ Folder:
# Purpose: Contains all reusable components that are shared across different pages.
# This promotes the DRY principle and ensures that common UI elements are centralized.
# Subfolders: Organized by component type (e.g., buttons, forms, layout),
# making it easy to locate and manage these components.

# pages/ Folder:
# Purpose: Houses components that are specific to individual pages.
# These components are only relevant within the context of a particular page or feature.
# Subfolders: Each page or feature has its own folder, making it clear which components
# belong to which part of the application.

# layouts/ Folder:
# Purpose: Stores layout components that define the structure of various pages.
# Layouts often wrap around page-specific components and might be reused across
# different sections of the application.

# Benefits of This Structure:
# Clarity and Maintainability: Developers can easily navigate the component structure,
# knowing exactly where to find common components versus page-specific ones.
# Scalability: The structure can scale with the project, accommodating new pages,
# features, and reusable components without becoming cluttered.
# Consistency: Aligns with Ant Design’s principles by ensuring consistent use of
# components across the application, reducing redundancy and promoting best practices.
# Reusability: Encourages the creation of reusable components, reducing code duplication
# and making updates easier across the project.

# This structure offers a flexible yet organized approach, suitable for complex applications
# with multiple pages and shared UI components.
